                    Personal Statement. Having originally studied Digital Media
                    Technology BSc (1st Class Honours) I began my career in
                    print and digital, accumulating a wide range of experience
                    across multiple platforms which I have thoroughly enjoyed.

                    However, my passion has always been front end development
                    and user interface design. I have worked with a diverse
                    range of clients to develop and deliver digital products,
                    incorporating both my design and development skills. I find
                    process driven digital work which will serve a purpose or
                    end goal to the user very rewarding.

                    I am constantly keeping up to date with digital technologies
                    and trends, whether that be through following technical
                    articles online, or via independent training/learning. In
                    all of my roles I have been required to develop
                    relationships both internally and externally - with
                    stakeholders, senior management and clients.
